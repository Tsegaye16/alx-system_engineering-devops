# You can copy this to one of:

# - "/etc/mysql/my.cnf" to set global options,

# - "~/.my.cnf" to set user-specific options.

#

# One can use all long options that the program supports.

# Run program with --help to get a list of available options and with

# --print-defaults to see which it would actually understand and use.

#

# For explanations see

# http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/server-system-variables.html

# This will be passed to all mysql clients

# It has been reported that passwords should be enclosed with ticks/quotes

# escpecially if they contain "#" chars...
